### ⚠️ DEPRECATED ⚠️

We have created a new project called [Chat Widget Adapters](https://github.com/livechat/chat-widget-adapters). It contains a set of packages which support more frontend frameworks integration with LiveChat Chat Widget in a modern way aligned with each framework specificity in mind.

From now on it will be the official, actively maintained repository for each framework-specific package that allows easy integration of LiveChat Chat Widget. The React package [@livechat/widget-react](http://npm.im/@livechat/widget-react) is one of available optoions. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/livechat/chat-widget-adapters/blob/master/packages/widget-react/README.md).

# LiveChat for React

This is a React component to easily add [LiveChat widget](https://www.livechatinc.com/) to your application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To use LiveChat in your React application, you will need LiveChat license ID. 

If you already have a LiveChat account, get your **license_id** [here](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/code).

![LiveChat license ID](https://github.com/livechat/react-livechat/blob/master/license.png)

If you don't have an account, you can create one [here](https://www.livechatinc.com/).

### Installation

To import LiveChat for React, run the following command:

```javascript
npm install react-livechat --save
```

## User Guide

### Start

Having imported LiveChat for React, put it in your render method:

```javascript
import LiveChat from 'react-livechat'

...

<LiveChat license={your_license_id} />
```

### Group

You can set up group directly in `LiveChat` component prop. Thanks to this, all chats will be routed to the specified group:

```javascript
<LiveChat license={your_license_id} group={3} />
```

Here you can learn more about groups: [Dividing live chat by group](https://www.livechatinc.com/kb/dividing-live-chat-by-group/).

#### Separated chat sessions

You can separate chat sessions between groups by using `chatBetweenGroups` prop:

```javascript
<LiveChat license={your_license_id} group={3} chatBetweenGroups={false} />
```

[Here](https://www.livechatinc.com/kb/dividing-live-chat-by-group/#separate-chat-sessions) is an article about it.

### Visitor's details

If you already know who your visitor is, you can set up his/her name and/or email:

```javascript
<LiveChat license={your_license_id} visitor={{name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com'}} />
```

### Custom variables

Custom variables are additional details that you can pass to LiveChat from the code (i.e., login or profile link). Here is how to make it:

```javascript
const params = [
  { name: 'Login', value: 'joe_public' },
  { name: 'Account ID', value: 'ABCD1234' },
  { name: 'Total order value', value: '$123' }
];

<LiveChat license={your_license_id} params={params} />
```

### Customization

You can change the look and feel of your chat widget in [Settings > Chat window](https://my.livechatinc.com/settings/theme) section.

### Methods

This module uses [LiveChat JS API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/js-api/). 

Get your chat reference using `onChatLoaded` callback:

```javascript
<LiveChat 
  onChatLoaded={ ref => this.livechat = ref }
  license={your_license_id} 
/>
```

You have access to all methods and variables of [LiveChat JS API](https://docs.livechatinc.com/js-api/) with your `livechat` reference or
`window.LC_API`.

Example:
```javascript
this.livechat.hide_chat_window();
// is the same as:
window.LC_API.hide_chat_window();
```

### LC_Invite exception

Sometimes it can happen that `LC_Invite` is  is still being loaded when `onChatLoaded` is called.
To ensure that `LC_Invite` is loaded you can give additional check to `onChatLoaded` function:
```js
onChatLoaded = (ref) => {
 ref.on_after_load = function ()  {
    //here you can use any method you want!
  }		
}
```
